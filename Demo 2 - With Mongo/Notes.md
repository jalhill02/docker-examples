Goals: Add another service to our docker-compose

1. Add mongo to our docker compose file / add our db connection to app.js
    - Talk about the format of our connection string
    - Talk about depends_on

2. Show what happens it we run `docker-compose up app` without `depends_on`


// TODO - maybe touch on volumes here...
